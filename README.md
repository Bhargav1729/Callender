the code starts from a certain date you can change it from 
def mpage(yy=xxxx,mm=xx)
you can give any number in place of x's which are present in any regualar callender

you can easily change dates when the code is executed but clicking the "<<"(backward) or ">>"(forward) buttons given respectively for the year and months and the buttons are given beside the year and month to reduce confusion

you can click on any date and save the date for anything like someone's birthday or any other important dates and after saving dates turn green for convinience in finding dates you saved and you didn't

if the saved date is useless then you can also simply delete it just by clicking the date then clicking the delete button 

hope you like this simple project😁
